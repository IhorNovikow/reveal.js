					<section><h3>Introduction</h3></section>
					<section>
						Machine learning is the science of making artificial intelligence learn and act like a human, 
							and make it continuously improve its learning and abilities based on the real-world data we provide.
					</section>
					<section>Here is how machine learning is defined by representatives of leading IT companies and research centers:</section>
					<section>Nvidia: "It's the practice of using algorithms to analyze data, study it, and then determine or predict something."</section>
					<section>Stanford University: "It's the science of making computers work without being explicitly programmed."</section>
					<section>University of Washington: "Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to do important tasks by generalizing from the examples they have."</section>
					<section>Carnegie Mellon University: “The field of machine learning is trying to answer the question: “How can we create 
						computer systems that automatically improve with experience and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?”</section>

					<section><h3>History of creation.</h3></section>
					<section style="position: absolut; width: 120%; top: 0.5%; left: -10%">
						<div>In 1959, Arthur Samuel, an artificial intelligence researcher, coined the term "machine learning".
							He invented the first self-learning checkers computer program. Samuel defined machine
							learning as a process by which computers are able to display the behavior that they
							was not originally programmed.</div>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Below are other important dates in the history of machine learning:</h3></section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">The first computer with a prototype of artificial intelligence appeared in 1946 - in the ENIAC project,
							a top-secret US Army project. It could be used for electronic computing and many other tasks;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 1950, the Alan Turing test appeared to assess the intelligence of a computer.
							With its help, the scientist proposed to determine whether a computer is capable of thinking like a person;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 1958, the American neuroscientist Frank Rosenblatt came up with
							Perceptron - the first artificial neural network, as well as the first Mark-1 neurocomputer;</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 1959, an American researcher of artificial intelligence
							Marvin Minsky created SNARC, the first computer based on a neural network;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In the same year, his colleague Arthur Samuel invented the first
							self-taught chess program. He first introduced term "machine learning", describing it 
							as a process by which a machine shows behavior that was not originally programmed for;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 1967, the first metric algorithm was created for
							data classification, which allowed artificial intelligence to use patterns 
							for recognition and learning;</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 1997, the Deep Blue program beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov for the first time;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 2006, neural network researcher Geoffrey Hinton coined the term "deep learning";</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 2011, Google Brain was founded, a division of Google that is engaged in projects in the 
							field of artificial intelligence;</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 2012, within another division - Google X Lab - developed
							neural network algorithm for recognizing cats in photos and videos. At the same time, Google launched a cloud
							Google Prediction API service for machine learning, which analyzes unstructured data;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 2014, Facebook developed the DeepFace neural network to recognize
							faces in photos and videos. Its algorithm works with 97% accuracy;</p>
						<p style="font-size:35px;">In 2015, Amazon launched Amazon Machine Learning −
							machine learning platform, a few months later a similar one appeared in
							Microsoft: Distributed Learning Machine Toolkit.</p>

					<section>
						<ol >
							<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Scope of machine learning:</h6>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Banks</li>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Investments</li>

					<section><h3>How machine learning works</h3></section>
					<section>
						<h3 style="font-size:30px;">To solve problems, neural networks need:</h3>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Data - examples of decisions and everything that can help in the learning process:
							statistics, examples of texts, calculations, indicators, historical events. Data collected over the years
							and combined into huge arrays - datasets that all IT corporations have. collection example
							is a captcha that asks you to select all photos with cars and remembers the correct answers;</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Signs - they are properties or characteristics. This is what should
							pay attention to the machine in the learning process. For example, stock price, animal image,
							frequency of words or gender of a person. The fewer signs and the more clearly they are designated and decorated,
							the easier it is to learn. However, for complex tasks, modern models have to take into account dozens of
							millions of parameters that determine how inputs are converted to outputs;</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Algorithms are a way of solving a problem. For the same task
							there can be many and it is important to choose the most accurate and effective.</p>

					<section><h3>Machine learning methods.</h3></section>
					<section>
						<ol >
							<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Main types of machine learning:</h6>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Classical training</li>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Reinforcement learning</li>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Ensembles</li>
							<li style="font-size:35px; margin-left:100px">Neural networks and deep learning</li>
						</ol>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Classical training</h6>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Supervised learning - when a machine has a certain teacher,
							who knows which answer is correct. This means that the original data
							labeled (sorted) in the right way, and the machine only needs to determine
							an object with the desired attribute or calculate the result.</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Learning without a teacher - when the machine itself must
							find the right solution among the chaotic data and sort the objects
							on unknown grounds. For example, determine where the dog is in the photo.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Reinforcement learning</h6>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">This is a more complex type of learning, where artificial
							intelligence needs not only to analyze data, but to act
							independently in a real environment - be it a street, a house or a video game.
							The task of the robot is to minimize errors, for which he gets the opportunity
							continue to work without obstacles and failures.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">Ensembles</h6>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">
							Stacking - when different algorithms are trained separately,
							and then they pass their results to the input of the latter, which makes the decision;</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Bagging - when one algorithm is repeatedly trained
							on random samples, and then average the answers;</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Boosting - when algorithms are trained sequentially,
							while each one pays special attention to the mistakes of the previous one.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section><h6>Neural networks and deep learning</h6></section>

					<section>
						<h6 style="font-size:37px; margin-bottom: 50px;">There are two main structures used here:</h6>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Convolutional neural networks were the first to learn to recognize unlabeled
							images are the most complex objects for artificial intelligence. For this they break
							them into blocks, determine the dominant lines in each and compare with other images
							desired object;</p>
						<p style="font-size:28px;">Recurrent neural networks are responsible for text and speech recognition.
							They identify sequences in them and associate each unit - letter or sound - with the rest.</p>
